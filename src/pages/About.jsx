          I am a passionate Computer Engineering student with strong motivation in developing real-world applications. My focus lies in mobile and backend development, and I am currently improving my skills through hands-on projects. Recently, I developed a Flutter-based Pomodoro productivity app, where I designed a responsive UI, implemented custom timer logic, and managed state efficiently using Flutterâ€™s native tools.
          I enjoy solving problems, learning modern technologies, and building clean, scalable software. I aim to contribute to innovative teams and continuously grow as a developer.
